Created: Spring 2023

Assembly Program written in HCS12/9S12 Assembly that allows a user to input a master pin and a user pin to check if it correctly matches. A yellow LED will light up once the master pin is set, a red LED will light up if the pin does not match, and a green LED will light up if the pin is correct. 

Additionally, by using a development board that supports sound such as a Dragon12 Light or Dragon12 JR, a siren will sound if the pin is correct, thus "unlocking the safe".

Written in HCS12/9S12 Assembly using AsmIDE 3.40 (in Spring 2023) Program was tested using a Dragon12 JR Development Board.
